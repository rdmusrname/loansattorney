Audiences expect to be actively involved in  the storytelling process, participating in polls quizzes and other interactive elements that draw them deeper into the narrative. This engagement  fosters a sense of ownership and connection,  transforming  passive  listeners into  active participants in the story. By incorporating interactive  elements storytellers can create immersive  experiences that captivate  audiences  and leave a lasting impression.
